# DinoData
Hello! This is all the work we've analyzed for this hackathon stored here. <br>
There will be a small descriptor for each file in our github to properly organize and describe each file's purpose. <br>

The Files: <br>
data.csv : is the raw data we found that had a lot of data we could work with. <br>
data_cleaner.ipynb : is a jupyter notebook that we used to wrangle and clean our chosen dataset. <br>
dino_data_cleaned.csv : is the cleaned data as a result of wrangling from the data_cleaner notebook. <br>

Diet_Analysis.ipynb : using our cleaned data, we analyzed the relation or possible correlation between a dinosaur's diet and their average lifespan and size. <br>
TypePeriod_Analysis.ipynb : using our cleaned data, we analyzed whether the midpoint of a dinosaur's existence relates to their length. <br>
